# ‚úÖ Welcome Email Fix Complete

## What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Welcome emails weren't being delivered to new hires.

**Root Cause:** The function was trying to send emails **FROM the new M365 account** via Microsoft Graph, but:
1. Mailbox might not be fully provisioned yet
2. Mail.Send permission might be missing
3. Silent failures with no fallback

**Solution:** Added **Resend fallback** ‚Äî if MS Graph fails, automatically use Resend.

## How It Works Now

### Email Sending Flow:

1. **First Attempt:** Try sending via Microsoft Graph (preferred)
   - Sends FROM: new M365 account
   - Better because it comes from the actual company email

2. **Fallback:** If MS Graph fails, use Resend
   - Sends FROM: onboarding@resend.dev
   - Always works, even if M365 isn't fully set up

### What Gets Sent:

**Subject:** `Welcome to Craven Inc ‚Äì Your company email and login`

**Contents:**
- New email address (e.g., `jsmith.cfo@cravenusa.com`)
- Role alias (if executive, e.g., `cfo@cravenusa.com`)
- **Temporary password** for first login
- Link to Office 365 portal
- MFA enrollment instructions

### Email Tracking:

‚úÖ All welcome emails are logged to `email_logs` table  
‚úÖ Status tracked (sent/failed)  
‚úÖ Visible in "View Emails" in Personnel Manager  

## Verification

**Check Supabase Edge Function logs:**
```
‚úÖ Welcome email sent via Microsoft Graph to: john@example.com
‚úÖ Welcome email sent via Resend to: john@example.com
‚ùå Failed to send via MS Graph, trying Resend fallback: [error]
‚ùå Failed to send via Resend: [error]
```

**Check database:**
```sql
-- See all welcome emails sent
SELECT * FROM email_logs 
WHERE email_type = 'ms365_welcome'
ORDER BY sent_at DESC;

-- Check provisioning status
SELECT * FROM ms365_email_accounts
WHERE provisioning_status = 'active'
ORDER BY provisioned_at DESC;
```

## Testing

**To test the fix:**
1. Hire a new employee
2. Watch for the success notification: "üìß M365 account created: [email]"
3. Check the employee's personal email for welcome message
4. If email not received, check Supabase logs

**Check logs:**
- Go to: Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí msgraph-provision ‚Üí Logs
- Look for: "‚úÖ Welcome email sent via..." or "‚ùå Failed to send..."

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and deployed

**Next deployment:** Edge function will auto-update on next deploy or you can manually deploy via Supabase Dashboard.
