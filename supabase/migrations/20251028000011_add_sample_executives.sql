-- Add sample executives for Board Portal testing (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)
-- These are demo accounts - in production, create real auth.users first

-- Note: This migration is for development/demo purposes only
-- Production environments should NEVER have placeholder executives
-- Real executives must be created via Supabase Auth UI with proper authentication

-- See migration 20251028000012_make_exec_users_flexible.sql for schema changes
