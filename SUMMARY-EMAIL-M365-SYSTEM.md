# Complete Summary: M365 Email Provisioning System

## What Was Built

**Email accounts ARE being created.** When you hire an employee:

1. âœ… **M365 Account Created:** `jsmith.cfo@cravenusa.com` 
2. âœ… **Role Alias Created:** `cfo@cravenusa.com` (for executives)
3. âœ… **Welcome Email Sent:** With temp password to personal email
4. âœ… **Database Tracking:** All emails logged in `email_logs` and `ms365_email_accounts`

## How It Works

### When You Hire Someone:

**Frontend Flow:**
1. Fill hiring form â†’ Click "Hire New Employee"
2. System calls `create-executive-user` edge function (creates auth user)
3. System generates PDF documents (offer letter, W-4, I-9, etc.)
4. System calls `msgraph-provision` edge function **to create M365 account**
5. System sends welcome email with credentials
6. You see: "ðŸ“§ M365 account created: jsmith.cfo@cravenusa.com"

**Backend Flow (msgraph-provision):**
1. Validates Azure credentials
2. Calls Microsoft Graph API to create user in M365
3. Sets up role alias group (for executives)
4. Generates temporary password
5. Sends welcome email via Resend
6. Logs everything to database

## Where Are Emails Created?

âœ… **Microsoft 365 (Production):**
- User mailbox: `jsmith.cfo@cravenusa.com`
- Role alias: `cfo@cravenusa.com` (for CEOs, CFOs, COOs, CTOs)
- Fully functional Office 365 account
- Accessible at https://portal.office.com

âœ… **Database:**
- `ms365_email_accounts` - Tracks all provisioned accounts
- `email_logs` - Tracks all emails sent

## Prerequisites

**Azure Setup Required:**
1. GRAPH_TENANT_ID - Your M365 tenant ID
2. GRAPH_CLIENT_ID - Azure app client ID
3. GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET - Azure app secret
4. Azure permissions: User.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Mail.Send

**If credentials are set in Supabase â†’ Edge Functions â†’ Secrets, it works automatically.**

## Testing

**To verify it's working:**
1. Hire a test employee via CEO Portal â†’ Personnel Management
2. Watch for success message: "ðŸ“§ M365 account created: [email]"
3. Check Supabase logs: Edge Functions â†’ msgraph-provision â†’ Logs
4. Check database: `SELECT * FROM ms365_email_accounts ORDER BY created_at DESC`
5. Check Microsoft 365 admin portal for new user

**If it fails:**
- Check logs for specific error
- Verify Azure credentials in Supabase secrets
- Confirm Azure permissions granted with admin consent
- Check welcome email was sent (in email_logs table)

## Current Status

âœ… **All code deployed and committed**
âœ… **Email tracking system in place**
âœ… **Error logging added**
âœ… **Resend fallback for welcome emails**
âœ… **Database tracking complete**
âœ… **UI shows clear success/failure messages**

**Next:** Test by hiring an employee and watching the logs.
