## ðŸ“‹ **DEPLOY NOW**

### **Step 1: Copy SQL File**

I've opened `DEPLOY-ALL-BUSINESS-SYSTEMS.sql` for you. 

**COPY ALL text from that file** (890 lines).

### **Step 2: Paste into Supabase**

1. Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xaxbucnjlrfkccsfiddq/sql/new**
2. Paste all SQL
3. Click **RUN**

You should see: **"Success. No rows returned"**

---

## âœ… **VERIFY**

Run this in SQL Editor to check tables were created:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN (
    'operations_metrics', 
    'fleet_vehicles', 
    'partner_vendors', 
    'it_infrastructure', 
    'it_incidents', 
    'procurement_categories', 
    'marketing_campaigns', 
    'legal_documents'
  )
ORDER BY table_name;
```

Should return 8 rows!

## ðŸŽ‰ **YOU'RE DONE!**

**Frontend is already configured** - portals will work as soon as database tables exist!

Test:
- `coo.cravenusa.com` â†’ COO Operations Portal
- `cto.cravenusa.com` â†’ CTO Technology Portal

---

**Next:** Create COO/CTO users in `exec_users` table when ready.
