# Driver Application Rebuild Complete ✅

## What Was Built

### New Full-Page Application Wizard

**Route:** `/driver-onboarding/apply`

A complete, full-page application experience replacing the old multi-page flow.

### Application Flow

1. **Terms & Privacy** → Legal consent with checkboxes
2. **Basic Information** → Signup form with zone assignment  
3. **Waitlist Confirmation** → Success screen with next steps

**No ICA signing** - That comes later when activated!

## How It Works

### Step 1: Legal Consent
1. User lands on `/driver-onboarding/apply`
2. Sees Terms & Privacy step
3. Must check both boxes to continue
4. Links open ToS and Privacy in new tabs
5. No data saved yet

### Step 2: Basic Information
1. User fills out signup form
2. On submit:
   - Creates `auth.users` entry
   - Finds or creates zone by ZIP
   - Creates `drivers` record
   - Creates `user_profiles` entry
   - Inserts into `driver_waitlist`
   - **Status:** `started`

### Step 3: Waitlist Confirmation
1. Success message displayed
2. Explains waitlist process
3. Shows next steps
4. No further action required

## Database Integration

### Zones Table
- Auto-lookup by ZIP code
- Auto-create if zone doesn't exist
- Simple state detection (Ohio default)

### Drivers Table
- Status: `started`
- Links to zone via `zone_id`
- Full user info stored

### Driver Waitlist
- Entry created immediately
- Links driver → zone
- Position auto-calculated by zone

### User Profile
- Basic profile created
- Role: `driver`

## Route Structure

```
/driver-onboarding/apply → DriverApplicationWizard (NEW)
```

**Legacy routes still exist** for backwards compatibility:
- `/driver-onboarding/signup` → Old signup form
- `/driver-onboarding/consent` → Old legal consent
- `/driver-onboarding/identity` → Old identity form
- `/driver-onboarding/background-check` → Old background check
- `/driver-onboarding/sign-agreement` → Old ICA signing
- `/driver-onboarding/waitlist` → Old waitlist reveal
- `/driver-onboarding/activation` → Old activation

---

## What Happens Next

### When Driver Submits:
1. ✅ Account created
2. ✅ Basic info saved
3. ✅ Zone assigned
4. ✅ Waitlist entry created
5. ✅ Confirmation shown

### Future Flow (Not Yet Implemented):
1. Admin activates zone
2. Email sent to waitlisted drivers
3. Driver completes ICA signing
4. Background check initiated
5. Onboarding tasks assigned
6. Driver goes live

---

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/driver-onboarding/apply`
2. Accept Terms & Privacy
3. Fill out basic info form
4. Submit application
5. See waitlist confirmation

### Expected Database:
- `auth.users` - New user created
- `drivers` - Driver record with zone_id
- `user_profiles` - Profile created
- `zones` - Zone found or created
- `driver_waitlist` - Waitlist entry

---

## Improvements Made

### Before:
- ❌ Multiple separate pages
- ❌ No legal consent upfront
- ❌ ICA signing before waitlist
- ❌ Confusing navigation
- ❌ No progress indicator

### After:
- ✅ Full-page wizard
- ✅ Legal consent first
- ✅ Waitlist before ICA
- ✅ Clear step progression
- ✅ Visual progress indicator
- ✅ Better UX flow

## Next Steps (For Future)

The wizard currently stops at 3 steps. Additional steps can be added later:

1. **Vehicle Information** - Car details, bike, or walk
2. **Background Check** - SSN collection, authorization
3. **ICA Signing** - Independent Contractor Agreement
4. **Documents Upload** - License, insurance, etc.
5. **Onboarding Tasks** - Profile, photo, quiz

All future steps will plug into the same wizard framework!
