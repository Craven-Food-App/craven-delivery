# ✅ HR Document System Complete

## The Problem You Asked About
> **"where the hell are the documents stored? where is the contracts, hire documents?"**

### What Was Broken:
1. **DocumentVault showed empty** - just TODOs, no actual fetching
2. **No documents stored** - PersonnelManager only sent HTML emails
3. **No database links** - documents weren't linked to employees
4. **Dummy exec_users** - C-level hires had `user_id: null`

## The Fix

### ✅ Now Documents Are:
- **Stored** in Supabase `hr-documents` bucket
- **Linked** to employees in `employee_documents` table
- **Visible** in Board Portal Document Vault
- **Tracked** with board resolutions
- **Emailed** to new hires
- **Downloadable** from portal

### ✅ When You Hire Now:
1. Creates REAL auth.user account
2. Generates PDF documents (HTML formatted)
3. Stores in `hr-documents` bucket
4. Records in `employee_documents` table
5. Links to board_resolutions
6. Emails to new hire
7. **Appears in Board Portal Document Vault**
