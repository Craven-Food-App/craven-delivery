# Next Step: Fix Production

## What We Know Now:

✅ You ran the `get_document_type_summary()` function  
✅ It returned "Success. No rows returned"  
✅ This means `employee_documents` table EXISTS but is EMPTY  

## What This Tells Us:

The table structure exists, but there's no data yet. This is **normal** if you haven't generated documents for executives yet.

## Next Steps:

### 1. **Verify All Tables Exist**
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check which tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE '%employee%' 
OR table_name LIKE '%document%'
OR table_name LIKE '%executive%'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

### 2. **Check Your CEO Portal**
Go to: `https://cravenusa.com/ceo-portal`

Does it load now? The error might be fixed if the table exists.

### 3. **If Still Errors**
Check browser console (F12) for the exact error message.

### 4. **Generate Test Documents**
If everything works, generate documents for existing executives:
- Go to CEO Portal → Personnel
- Click "Resend Documents" for each exec
