## ðŸ”„ **TO TEST COO PORTAL**

Run this in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Switch your role to COO
UPDATE public.exec_users 
SET role = 'coo', title = 'Chief Operating Officer', department = 'Operations'
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'craven@usa.com');

-- Verify
SELECT eu.role, u.email, eu.title
FROM public.exec_users eu
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = eu.user_id
WHERE u.email = 'craven@usa.com';
```

Then refresh: **`coo.cravenusa.com`**

**COO Portal Features:**
- Fleet Management (vehicles)
- Partners & Vendors

## ðŸŽ¯ **COMPLETE YOUR SETUP**

### **Option 1: Single User (Switching Roles)**
Good for testing/debugging:
- Run the UPDATE commands above to switch between COO/CTO

### **Option 2: Separate Users** (Recommended for Production)
Create dedicated users:
1. Go to: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Users â†’ Add User
2. Create: `coo@cravenusa.com` and `cto@cravenusa.com`
3. Run `ADD-COO-CTO-USERS.sql` with different emails
