# Executive Signature 404: Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed (Code)
1. **Route exists**: `/executive-sign` in `App.tsx`
2. **Component exists**: `ExecutiveSignature.tsx`
3. **Edge functions**: Deployed and working
4. **No auth required**: Token-based access (by design)

## ‚ùì What's Unknown
Production deployment status - is latest code live?

---

## üîß To Actually Fix 404:

### Check GitHub Actions
Open: https://github.com/Craven-Food-App/craven-delivery/actions

Look for recent workflow runs after your commits.

### If Not Deployed:
1. Wait for auto-deploy (CI/CD may be set up)
2. Or manually trigger deployment
3. Or deploy manually to Vercel/Netlify

---

## üß™ Test Once Deployed:
URL: `https://cravenusa.com/executive-sign?token=test`

Should show signature form (not 404)

---

**Bottom line:** Code is fixed. Need production deployment to resolve 404.
