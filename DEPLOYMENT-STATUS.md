## To Fix:

### Option 1: Check GitHub Actions
```
https://github.com/Craven-Food-App/craven-delivery/actions
```
Look for recent deployments to Vercel/Netlify

### Option 2: Manual Deploy
```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Deploy manually to production
# (depends on where cravenusa.com is hosted)
```

### Option 3: Force Trigger Deployment
```bash
# Create empty commit to trigger CI/CD
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger: force deployment for executive signature fix"
git push
```

## Expected Behavior:
- URL: `https://cravenusa.com/executive-sign?token=abc123`
- Should show signature form
- No authentication required
- Token validates via edge function

---

## Verification:
Once deployed, test with a real offer letter link from CEO Portal.
