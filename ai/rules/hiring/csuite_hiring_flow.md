# ⚙️ **Crave’n Inc. – C-Suite Hiring & Appointment Automation Rule**

```md
# Purpose
Define how Cursor automates the appointment of new C-class executives (CEO, COO, CFO, CTO, CMO, General Admin) for Crave’n Inc.
This process generates all required legal documents, records equity, and manages deferred-salary logic.

---

## Trigger
When an admin user selects “Add New Executive” or “Appoint C-Level Role” inside the Crave’n Admin Dashboard.

---

## Step 1: Prompt for Required Executive Data
Cursor must prompt for and collect the following variables:

```

executive_name:
executive_title: [CEO, COO, CFO, CTO, CMO, Admin]
start_date:
equity_percent:
shares_issued:
equity_type: (default "Common Stock")
vesting_schedule: (default "4 years, 1-year cliff; 25% after 12 months, remainder monthly over 36 months")
strike_price: (default "$0.0001 per share")
annual_salary: (default "90000")
governing_law: (default "Ohio")

```

---

## Step 2: Deferred Salary Option
Include a checkbox or toggle labeled:

> **“Defer Salary Until Funding?”**

If checked:
```

salary_status = "deferred"
deferred_salary_clause = true
funding_trigger = 500000 (default USD)

```

If unchecked:
```

salary_status = "active"
deferred_salary_clause = false
funding_trigger = null

```

When deferred is selected, Cursor must insert the following clause into the generated Offer Letter and Deferred Compensation Agreement:

> **Deferred Salary Clause:**  
> “The Executive acknowledges that Crave’n Inc. is in an early, pre-revenue stage and will initially serve on an equity-only basis.  
> Upon the Company achieving a Funding Event—defined as closing a capital raise of at least $500,000 USD or achieving positive cash flow for three consecutive months—the Executive shall begin receiving a base annual salary of ${{annual_salary}} USD, payable according to standard payroll practices.  
> No back pay or retroactive wages shall accrue prior to the Funding Event.”

---

## Step 3: Document Generation
For every new executive, Cursor must generate and fill templates from `/legal/templates/` with collected variables.

**Templates:**
1. `EquityOfferAgreement.md`
2. `DeferredCompensationAgreement.md` *(only if deferred_salary_clause = true)*
3. `BoardResolution_OfficerAppointment.md`

All generated documents are to be saved in:
```

/legal/executives/{{executive_name}}/

```

**Fill-in Variables:**
```

{{executive_name}}
{{executive_title}}
{{equity_percent}}
{{shares_issued}}
{{equity_type}}
{{vesting_schedule}}
{{strike_price}}
{{annual_salary}}
{{salary_status}}
{{funding_trigger}}
{{governing_law}}
{{start_date}}

```

---

## Step 4: Board Resolution Logic
When generating `BoardResolution_OfficerAppointment.md`, Cursor inserts:

> “Resolved, that {{executive_name}} is hereby appointed as {{executive_title}} of Crave’n Inc., effective {{start_date}}, and is authorized to carry out the duties of such office.  
> Further Resolved, that {{shares_issued}} shares of {{equity_type}} are hereby issued to {{executive_name}} in consideration of services rendered, subject to the vesting schedule and terms set forth in the Equity Offer Agreement.”

---

## Step 5: Supabase / Database Sync
Cursor must update or create an entry in the `executives` table:

| Column | Value |
|--------|--------|
| name | {{executive_name}} |
| title | {{executive_title}} |
| equity_percent | {{equity_percent}} |
| shares_issued | {{shares_issued}} |
| salary_status | {{salary_status}} |
| annual_salary | {{annual_salary}} |
| funding_trigger | {{funding_trigger}} |
| vesting_schedule | {{vesting_schedule}} |
| strike_price | {{strike_price}} |
| created_at | current timestamp |

---

## Step 6: Confirmation Output
After generation, Cursor displays a structured confirmation summary:

```

✅ EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENT COMPLETE

Name: {{executive_name}}
Role: {{executive_title}}
Equity: {{equity_percent}}% ({{shares_issued}} shares)
Equity Type: {{equity_type}}
Vesting: {{vesting_schedule}}
Salary: ${{annual_salary}}/year
Deferred: {{salary_status}}
Funding Trigger: ${{funding_trigger}} (if applicable)
Documents Generated:
• Equity Offer Agreement
• {{Conditional: Deferred Compensation Agreement}}
• Board Resolution

```

---

## Step 7: File & Version Handling
- Cursor saves generated PDFs under `/legal/generated/{{executive_name}}/`.
- Cursor commits Markdown versions to the repo branch `legal/appointments`.
- If an executive already exists, prompt the admin to confirm an update or create a new revision.

---

## Step 8: Automation Chain
1. Create executive record → Generate documents → Save → Sync cap table.
2. If `salary_status = deferred`, tag record as `"equity_only"` in Supabase for filtering.
3. Once funding milestone met, Cursor triggers salary-activation workflow to convert record from `"deferred"` to `"active"` and generate Employment Agreement.

---

## Default Values (unless overridden)
```

equity_type = "Common Stock"
vesting_schedule = "4 years, 1-year cliff"
strike_price = "$0.0001 per share"
governing_law = "Ohio"
funding_trigger = "500000"
annual_salary = "90000"

```

---

## Notes
- All C-class roles are *appointed*, not employed, until funding.
- Use independent-contractor language until payroll is established.
- Cursor should never classify C-class executives as W-2 employees before funding activation.
- All generated documents must include the disclaimer:  
  *“This agreement reflects an equity-only officer appointment until such time as Crave’n Inc. achieves a qualifying funding event.”*
```
