# Executive Signature 404 Fix

## Status: âœ… **Working as Designed**

### Current Design
- **NO authentication required** to sign documents
- Token-based access from email links
- Submits via edge function (bypasses RLS)

### What Causes 404s
Production deployment missing or outdated

---

## How to Fix

### Quick Test
Open in browser:
```
https://cravenusa.com/executive-sign?token=test
```

Should show signature form (not 404)

### If 404
```bash
# 1. Build
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to production
# (Vercel/Netlify should auto-deploy from main branch)
```

## Design Confirmation

**Commit:** `42d462f - "remove login requirement"`

This was **intentional** - offers easier onboarding:
1. Executive receives email
2. Clicks link (no account needed)
3. Signs document
4. Account created afterward

---

**No code changes needed** - just ensure production is deployed.
